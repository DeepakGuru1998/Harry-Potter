# Invisibility Cloak 
In this python code, an invisibity cloak which is created which is similar to the one shown in harry potter movie. 
Based on the color you like, you can either use blue, green, or any other color that can be used as a cloak and you can hide inside that cloak. 

The code uses color detection, image processing techniques and bitwise array operations using OpenCV Library and performs the following invisibility technique. 
I have also attached the trackbar code which can be used to find out the required HSV color.
